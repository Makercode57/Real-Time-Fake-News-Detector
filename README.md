# Real-Time-Fake-News-Detector
The Fake News Detector project aims to create a web application that allows users to identify whether a news article is fake or real. Using Flask for the backend API layer and React for the frontend, the application processes user-submitted articles through a machine learning model to determine their authenticity.
